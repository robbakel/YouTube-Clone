# YouTube Clone

This is a static YouTube clone, which I used to practice different ways of using fake data and randomizing elements in JavaScript.

## Used resources

* [Web Dev Simplified's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhPSo4_Tgi0) for the basic structure of the HTML/CSS
* [faker.js](https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/) for the fake data
* [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos) for the image placeholders
